# progress_bars_demo

Program reads values of bars, buttons and the limit of progress bar from the endpoint.
Creates progress bars, buttons and a dropdown-menu for selection of which progress bar to modify dynamically.
The progress bars increment or decrement based on the buuton pressed. 
The bars change color when they hit the max value ie. 100
User can still keep on incrementing the bar value till the limit(value is recieved in the response from the endpoint)
Once it hits 0 nothing happens.
